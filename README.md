Hello and welcome to Sam's Piano
How to install and run- 
    Download the piano folder as a zip file and then extract it into your downloads folder.
    Then, in the piano foler, you will find a Jar file titled SamsMusicWare. Run that program from within the folder and you're good to go.
How to use the piano
    I included a graphic on the window on the different key to use the piano, but if its a bit confusing, I will explain here what to do.
    Initially, your top row of letter and number keys are what corresponds to the different piano keys where the Q key is a C and the 2 key is C sharp
    In this main mode, you can also play and manipulate chords which the keys to do so are as follows.
        The Enter key will make the next piano key you press play a major triad on top of the root note.
        The Shift key does the same as the enter key but as a minor triad.
        The backslash[\] key gives a diminished chord
        You can invert all of these chords into different inversions using the V key
        The slash[/] key will toggle the seventh of the chord and the dash[-] key will change between a major/minor/diminished seventh
        (The seventh chords can also be inverted)
        The N key turns on the ninth of the chord and the equals[=] key changes between major and minor ninths
    Besides chords there are several other actions you can use
        The up and down arrow keys change what octave you are playing ins
        the F1 - F12 keys allow you to play different drum beats, and you can scroll through the whole midi drum library with the left and right arrows
        The Z key will let you start a recording of whatever you are playing and the X key stops the recording. Press the A key to playback.
        The F key allows you to open up a more full piano that turns off all other key functions but lets you use the whole keyboard as a piano
Along with the piano, I have also added in a rudimentary music making system that can be accessed by pressing the C key
    In this song writing feature, checkbox the notes you want to be played at one time, and then check a note length.
    Once you are ready to add the note into what I'm calling a layer, click the button in the top left corner
    You can also change things like volume, tempo and instrument for your current layer.
    To hear what you have in your current layer, press the Play This Layer button.
    If you want to add your layer into a larger song, just click the add in layer button to add it in
    Once you have all the layers you want, you can see how they play together with the play all layers button.
    You can even save the songs you make with the Save This Song button that can then be played later.(I included Amazing Grace as a sample song to check out how this works)
    Additionally, by clicking the A button on the piano window, you can add anything you have recorded as a layer into your song.


This is a fairly rudimentary program that is pretty barebones in terms of things like GUI's and seamless functionality and I hope it isn't too confusing
 but I hope you can understand and have a little fun with it.
